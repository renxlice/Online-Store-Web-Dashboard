# Online Store Web Dashboard

Designed and developed a comprehensive, user-friendly, and modern web dashboard for an online store. This platform offers a seamless shopping experience and robust tools for efficient store management. Key features include:



Product Management: Simplified data management system for organizing product details, including price, description, category, and name. Products are categorized effectively (e.g., electronics, menâ€™s clothing, womenâ€™s clothing, childrenâ€™s clothing, sports equipment).



Advanced Analytics: Insights on frequently ordered products, preferred payment methods, product overview, and sales growth trends to support informed business decisions.



Responsive Design: Ensures the dashboard is visually appealing, modern, and accessible across devices, delivering an excellent user experience.



Enhanced Security: Restricted access for non-admin users, ensuring sensitive data remains protected and accessible only to authorized personnel.



Order Tracking & Invoices: Easy access to detailed order summaries and invoices for a clear view of completed transactions.



Detailed Product Information: Comprehensive product pages displaying price, description, and category, helping users make informed purchase decisions.



The project successfully blends functionality, aesthetics, and performance to meet the needs of both users and administrators.
